        abstract: Due to growing pollution concerns over the years, researchers are
            evaluating various optimization strategies to develop efficient bioremediation
            alternatives. Bioremediation encompasses numerous process types and each
            type and pollutant target require a different optimization approach. This
            chapter intends to provide an overview of knowledge gained from the bioremediation
            optimization studies performed to treat the most common pollutants. Available
            literature was classified according to bioremediation types affected by
            similar processing factors, viz., phytoremediation, bioaugmentation and
            biostimulation (in-situ bioremediation) and bioreactors, biosorption and
            enzymatic treatment (ex-situ bioremediation). We discussed and compared
            the optimization approach followed in each bioremediation type, critical
            factors affecting the processes, quality targets and process design. This
            chapter will provide a scientific and technical basis that can assist
            in the selection of design, process improvement, optimization and implementation
            of the bioremediation technology.

        abstract: 'This paper proposes an automatic tuning algorithm for a sliding
            mode controller (SMC) based on the Ackermann’s formula, that attenuates
            the structural vibrations of a seismically excited building equipped with
            an Active Tuned Mass Damper (ATMD) mounted on its top floor. The switching
            gain and sliding surface of the SMC are designed through the proposed
            tuning algorithm to suppress the structural vibrations by minimizing either
            the top floor displacement or the control force applied to the ATMD. Moreover,
            the tuning algorithm selects the SMC parameters to guarantee the following
            closed-loop characteristics: (1) the transient responses of the structure
            and the ATMD are sufficiently fast and damped; and (2) the control force,
            as well as the displacements and velocities of the building and ATMD are
            within acceptable limits under the frequency band of the earthquake excitation.
            The proposed SMC shows robustness against the unmodeled dynamics such
            as the friction of the damper. Experimental results on a reduced scale
            structure permits demonstrating the efficiency of the tuning algorithm
            for the SMC, which is compared with the traditional Linear Quadratic Regulator
            (LQR) and with the Optimal Sliding Mode Controller (OSMC).'

        abstract: This article presents a methodology to recycle and upgrade a 4-DOF
            educational robot manipulator with a gripper. The robot is upgraded by
            providing it an artificial vision that allows obtaining the position and
            shape of objects collected by it. A low-cost and open-source hardware
            solution is also proposed to achieve motion control of the robot through
            a decentralized control scheme. The robot joints are actuated through
            five direct current motors coupled to optical encoders. Each encoder signal
            is fed to a proportional integral derivative controller with anti-windup
            that employs the motor velocity provided by a state observer. The motion
            controller works with only two open-architecture Arduino Mega boards,
            which carry out data acquisition of the optical encoder signals. MATLAB-Simulink
            is used to implement the controller as well as a friendly graphical interface,
            which allows the user to interact with the manipulator. The communication
            between the Arduino boards and MATLAB-Simulink is performed in real-time
            utilizing the Arduino IO Toolbox. Through the proposed controller, the
            robot follows a trajectory to collect a desired object, avoiding its collision
            with other objects. This fact is verified through a set of experiments

        abstract: This paper proposes a novel Android application, named Control and
            Identification Toolbox (CIT), for performing real-time experiments of
            system response, automatic control, and parameter identification of dynamic
            systems. It permits tuning a traditional Proportional Integral Derivative
            controller (PID), whose performance under constant or noise disturbances,
            introduced by the app, can be analyzed during the experiments. Moreover,
            this app allows estimating the parameters of first- and second-order linear
            systems by means of the Recursive Least Squares Method. The parameter
            estimates, as well as control system signals produced under common test
            input signals are displayed by the app. It runs in any Android device
            supporting a universal serial bus (USB), which is connected with Arduino
            Uno or Mega boards that carry out data acquisition. Experimental results
            obtained using a physical circuit, composed by a first-order low-pass
            filter, confirm the effectiveness of the proposed application.

        abstract: This article presents a free Android application, named as Control
            and Identification Toolbox (CIT), for teaching and learning the system
            response, automatic control, and the parameter identification of dynamic
            systems. The CIT app performs real-time experiments and permits tuning
            a traditional proportional-integral-derivative controller, whose performance
            under constant or noise disturbances, introduced by the app, can be analyzed.
            Moreover, this app allows estimating the parameters of first- and second-order
            linear systems by means of the recursive least squares method. The parameter
            estimates as well as the control system signals produced under common
            test input signals are displayed by the app. It runs in any Android device
            supporting a universal serial bus, which is connected with Arduino Uno
            or Mega boards that carry out data acquisition. Experimental results obtained
            using first- and second-order low-pass filters confirm the effectiveness
            of the proposed application. Moreover, undergraduate students evaluated
            the CIT app, and their responses are also presented.

        abstract: The auto-tuning proportional-integral-derivative (PID) controllers
            based on genetic algorithms have many limitations in their implementation.
            For example, some chromosomes of the tuned genetic algorithms may cause
            closed-loop system instability, and some chromosomes tuned for an operating
            condition may cause instability for other operating conditions. This article
            provides the possible solutions for these problems. An implementation
            technique of a genetic algorithm is proposed based on these solutions.

            to a system with variable parameters. Moreover, this technique is also
            used for controlling a brushless servo motor.

        abstract: El gobierno mexicano ha implementado una serie de reformas en busca
            de la promoción de energías limpias como la bioenergía, con el objetivo
            de alcanzar las metas propuestas para el año 2024, donde el 35% de la
            generación eléctrica provenga de energías limpias. La bioenergía en México
            representa el 4.22% del total de la generación de la electricidad en el
            país, destacando principalmente la tecnología del biogás y la quema de
            la biomasa directa a través del bagazo de caña de azúcar con 92 GWh y
            986 MWh respectivamente. Los estados del país que tienen alto potencial
            de generación son el Estado de México, Coahuila y Jalisco, por otra parte,
            los estados con mayor generación eléctrica a partir de bioenergía son
            Veracruz, Jalisco y Nuevo León, con una suma total de 855 GWh por año.
            México cuenta con gran potencial para la generación de biocombustibles,

            the existence of mental workload (MWL) and adaptability of a human operator
            (HO) in handling force augmenting devices (FADs). An experiment is conducted
            where the HOs of three different ages are allowed to handle a FAD with
            high augmentation factor. Augmentation factor gives the factor by which
            the HO's force is amplified. It is observed that the HOs were unable to
            stabilize the FAD for the first time. With the help of these experiments,
            it is observed that a human adapts itself to achieve a stable HA-FAD interaction.
            In another perspective, it can be observed that HO undergoes MWL to handle
            a FAD with high augmentation factor.

            Device
        journal: Journal of Intelligent & Robotic Systems
        year: '2016'
        pages: 1--10
        abstract: This paper presents a stability analysis of the interaction between
            a human and a linear moving Force Augmenting Device (FAD). The analysis
            employs a mathematical model of the human arm, the FAD and their interaction.
            As a depart from past works, this article presents a stability analysis
            considering time-delays in the human model. A key ingredient in the analysis
            is the use of the Rekasius substitution for replacing the time-delay terms.
            It is proved that the human machine interaction is stable when the human
            model has no delays. When delays are considered in the human model, the
            analysis provides an upper bound for the time-delays preserving a stable
            interaction. Numerical simulations allow to assess the human-FAD interaction.
            An experiment is performed with a laboratory prototype, where a human
            operator lifts a load. It is observed that the human machine interaction
            is stable and the human operator is able to move the load to a desired
            position by experiencing very little effort.

            Device and a Human Operator

        abstract: In this paper a one degree of freedom (DOF) force augmenting device
            (FAD) is presented. A laboratory set-up has been built and some tests
            of the interaction between the FAD and a user were performed. The stability
            of the closed loop system is essential for the performance of the FAD.
            The FAD by itself is a stable device, but what is important is to assure
            the stability of the interaction between the FAD and a human being. To
            deal with this matter, two situations were analyzed. The case of no delays
            in the model is first considered. This situation might appear unrealistic,
            for this reason, a second analysis is performed considering a human model
            with delays. In order to deal with delays a Rekasius substitution is used.
            To perform the stability analysis, it is sufficient to apply the Routh-Hurtwitz
            criteria. Attempts with other techniques have given more conservative
            stability results. The stability has been proven for delays smaller than
            upper-bounds which have been computed. None of these upper-bounds are
            reached by any healthy human being. Therefore, we can assure that the
            whole system is stable for most of the practical situations. This proves
            the robustness of the closed loop system with respect to delays. In real
            time experiments, measurement from the sensors are normally noisy. In
            order to reduce the effect of the noise, a low pass filter was included.
            The introduction of this filter alters the order of the system, changing
            the stability conditions of the whole set up. So the stability analysis
            is performed again with the inclusion of the filter.

        abstract: This thesis presents a one degree of freedom (DOF) linear force
            augmenting device (FAD), a human arm (HA) model, a model of the FAD-HA
            interaction, a stability analysis for the system resulting from the FAD-HA
            interaction, and finally numerical simulations and experimental results.
            The FAD consists of an electrical motor and a ball-screw mechanism that
            converts the torque generated by the electric motor to a force that moves
            a load. A force sensor is attached to the load to capture the force applied
            by the human operator to the FAD. The control algorithm presented in this
            thesis allows the user to feel part of the load all the time, even at
            the rest position. A linear model for the HA is employed to study the
            stability of the FAD-HA interaction. As a depart from past works, this
            work presents a stability analysis considering time-delays in the human
            model. A key ingredient in the analysis is the use of the Rekasius substitution
            for replacing the time-delay terms. It is proved that the FAD-HA interaction
            is stable when the human model has no delays. When delays are considered
            in the human model, the analysis performed provides upper bounds for the
            time-delays below which a stable interaction is assured. Numerical simulations
            are presented, which allow assessing the FAD-HA interaction. Experimentation
            is performed with a laboratory prototype with which several human operators
            lift a load. It is observed that the FAD-HA interaction is stable and
            that the human operator is able to lift the load to its desired position
            by experiencing an effort that can always be controlled.
