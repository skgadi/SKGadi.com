        title: An android application for system identification and automatic control

        year: '2019'
        pages: 600--605
        abstract: This paper proposes a novel Android application, named Control and
            Identification Toolbox (CIT), for performing real-time experiments of
            system response, automatic control, and parameter identification of dynamic
            systems. It permits tuning a traditional Proportional Integral Derivative
            controller (PID), whose performance under constant or noise disturbances,
            introduced by the app, can be analyzed during the experiments. Moreover,
            this app allows estimating the parameters of first- and second-order linear
            systems by means of the Recursive Least Squares Method. The parameter
            estimates, as well as control system signals produced under common test
            input signals are displayed by the app. It runs in any Android device
            supporting a universal serial bus (USB), which is connected with Arduino
            Uno or Mega boards that carry out data acquisition. Experimental results
            obtained using a physical circuit, composed by a first-order low-pass
            filter, confirm the effectiveness of the proposed application.

        abstract: Abstract This article presents a free Android application, named
            as Control and Identification Toolbox (CIT), for teaching and learning
            the system response, automatic control, and the parameter identification
            of dynamic systems. The CIT app performs real-time experiments and permits
            tuning a traditional proportional-integral-derivative controller, whose
            performance under constant or noise disturbances, introduced by the app,
            can be analyzed. Moreover, this app allows estimating the parameters of
            first- and second-order linear systems by means of the recursive least
            squares method. The parameter estimates as well as the control system
            signals produced under common test input signals are displayed by the

            Moreover, undergraduate students evaluated the CIT app, and their responses
            are also presented.

        abstract: A multi-agent system (MAS) is suitable for addressing tasks in a
            variety of domains without any programmed behaviors, which makes it ideal
            for the problems associated with the mobile robots. Reinforcement learning
            (RL) is a successful approach used in the MASs to acquire new behaviors;
            most of these select exact Q-values in small discrete state space and
            action space. This article presents a joint Q-function linearly fuzzified
            for a MAS&rsquo; continuous state space, which overcomes the dimensionality
            problem. Also, this article gives a proof for the convergence and existence
            of the solution proposed by the algorithm presented. This article also
            discusses the numerical simulations and experimental results that were
            carried out to validate the proposed algorithm.

            PID controller

        abstract: The auto-tuning proportional-integral-derivative (PID) controllers
            based on genetic algorithms have many limitations in their implementation.
            For example, some chromosomes of the tuned genetic algorithms may cause
            closed-loop system instability, and some chromosomes tuned for an operating
            condition may cause instability for other operating conditions. This article
            provides the possible solutions for these problems. An implementation
            technique of a genetic algorithm is proposed based on these solutions.
            Numerical simulations are given to evaluate the proposed method applied
            to a system with variable parameters. Moreover, this technique is also
            used for controlling a brushless servo motor.

        abstract: Abstract In this article, challenges in designing example problems
            of multifactorial experiments for an academic purpose are identified,
            and an algorithm for simulating multifactorial experiments is presented.
            It is based on a proposed mathematical function, which mimics a physical
            system, can be employed for any number of finite factors, and contains
            a unique peak, with which a unique optimal solution for an experiment
            is guaranteed. The proposed algorithm is implemented on an application
            developed with JavaScript, HTML, and CSS, which has been tested in the
            classroom for highlighting all characteristics of experimental design.

        abstract: El gobierno mexicano ha implementado una serie de reformas en busca
            de la promoción de energías limpias como la bioenergía, con el objetivo
            de alcanzar las metas propuestas para el año 2024, donde el 35% de la
            generación eléctrica provenga de energías limpias. La bioenergía en México
            representa el 4.22% del total de la generación de la electricidad en el
            país, destacando principalmente la tecnología del biogás y la quema de
            la biomasa directa a través del bagazo de caña de azúcar con 92 GWh y
            986 MWh respectivamente. Los estados del país que tienen alto potencial
            de generación son el Estado de México, Coahuila y Jalisco, por otra parte,
            los estados con mayor generación eléctrica a partir de bioenergía son
            Veracruz, Jalisco y Nuevo León, con una suma total de 855 GWh por año.
            México cuenta con gran potencial para la generación de biocombustibles,
            sin embargo, es un área que no ha sido explotada satisfactoriamente. Cabe
            mencionar que el país no cuenta con refinerías para la producción de etanol
            y actualmente sólo se contabilizan 4 plantas de biodiesel. Los impactos
            medioambientales producto de la bioenergía en México, son poco estudiados,
            sin embargo, la aplicación del análisis de ciclo de vida permitirá evaluar
            las cargas ambientales de esta forma de generación de energía.

        abstract: 'Abstract: This paper deals with the Maximal Covering Location Problem
            (MCLP) for Supply Chain optimization in the presence of incomplete information.
            A specific linear-integer structure of a generic mathematical model for
            Resilient Supply Chain Management System (RSCMS) makes it possible to
            reduce the originally given \{MCLP\} to two auxiliary optimization Knapsack-type
            problems. The equivalent transformation (separation) we propose provides
            a useful tool for an effective numerical treatment of the original \{MCLP\}
            and reduces the complexity of algorithms. The computational methodology
            we follow involves a specific Lagrange relaxation procedure. We give a
            rigorous formal analysis of the resulting algorithm and apply it to a
            practically oriented example of an optimal \{RSCMS\} design.'

        abstract: This contribution deals with a robust control design for general
            switched affine control systems. Dynamical models under consideration
            are described by ordinary differential equations involving a switching
            mechanism and in the presence of bounded uncertainties. The design procedure
            we analyse is based on the newly elaborated attractive ellipsoids method
            ([33]). The stability and robustness of the resulting closed-loop system
            involves an abstract Clarke stability theorem. A short discussion on the
            obtained analytic results and possible applications and extensions is
            also included.

        year: '2016'
        pages: 1--7
        abstract: This paper addresses the problem of robust control for a class of
            nonlinear dynamical systems in the continuous time domain. We deal with
            nonlinear models described by differential algebraic equations (DAEs)
            in the presence of bounded uncertainties. The full model of the control
            system under consideration is completed by linear sampling-type outputs.
            Main contribution of present manuscript is the proposal of a linear state
            feedback control design for this type of uncertain nonlinear system obtaining
            the required stability and robustness. Due to the need to the state feedback
            there is a need of the implementation of a Luenberguer observer. Finally,
            the applicability of the proposed method is illustrated by a computational
            example. A brief discussion on the main implementation issue is also included.

        title: Stability Analysis of a Human Arm Interacting with a Force Augmenting
            Device

        abstract: This paper presents a stability analysis of the interaction between
            a human and a linear moving Force Augmenting Device (FAD). The analysis
            employs a mathematical model of the human arm, the FAD and their interaction.
            As a depart from past works, this article presents a stability analysis
            considering time-delays in the human model. A key ingredient in the analysis
            is the use of the Rekasius substitution for replacing the time-delay terms.
            It is proved that the human machine interaction is stable when the human
            model has no delays. When delays are considered in the human model, the
            analysis provides an upper bound for the time-delays preserving a stable
            interaction. Numerical simulations allow to assess the human-FAD interaction.
            An experiment is performed with a laboratory prototype, where a human
            operator lifts a load. It is observed that the human machine interaction
            is stable and the human operator is able to move the load to a desired
            position by experiencing very little effort.

        abstract: In this paper a one degree of freedom (DOF) force augmenting device
            (FAD) is presented. A laboratory set-up has been built and some tests
            of the interaction between the FAD and a user were performed. The stability
            of the closed loop system is essential for the performance of the FAD.
            The FAD by itself is a stable device, but what is important is to assure
            the stability of the interaction between the FAD and a human being. To
            deal with this matter, two situations were analyzed. The case of no delays
            in the model is first considered. This situation might appear unrealistic,
            for this reason, a second analysis is performed considering a human model
            with delays. In order to deal with delays a Rekasius substitution is used.
            To perform the stability analysis, it is sufficient to apply the Routh-Hurtwitz
            criteria. Attempts with other techniques have given more conservative
            stability results. The stability has been proven for delays smaller than
            upper-bounds which have been computed. None of these upper-bounds are
            reached by any healthy human being. Therefore, we can assure that the
            whole system is stable for most of the practical situations. This proves
            the robustness of the closed loop system with respect to delays. In real
            time experiments, measurement from the sensors are normally noisy. In
            order to reduce the effect of the noise, a low pass filter was included.
            The introduction of this filter alters the order of the system, changing
            the stability conditions of the whole set up. So the stability analysis
            is performed again with the inclusion of the filter.

        abstract: This thesis presents a one degree of freedom (DOF) linear force
            augmenting device (FAD), a human arm (HA) model, a model of the FAD-HA
            interaction, a stability analysis for the system resulting from the FAD-HA
            interaction, and finally numerical simulations and experimental results.
            The FAD consists of an electrical motor and a ball-screw mechanism that
            converts the torque generated by the electric motor to a force that moves
            a load. A force sensor is attached to the load to capture the force applied
            by the human operator to the FAD. The control algorithm presented in this
            thesis allows the user to feel part of the load all the time, even at
            the rest position. A linear model for the HA is employed to study the
            stability of the FAD-HA interaction. As a depart from past works, this
            work presents a stability analysis considering time-delays in the human
            model. A key ingredient in the analysis is the use of the Rekasius substitution
            for replacing the time-delay terms. It is proved that the FAD-HA interaction
            is stable when the human model has no delays. When delays are considered
            in the human model, the analysis performed provides upper bounds for the
            time-delays below which a stable interaction is assured. Numerical simulations
            are presented, which allow assessing the FAD-HA interaction. Experimentation
            is performed with a laboratory prototype with which several human operators
            lift a load. It is observed that the FAD-HA interaction is stable and
            that the human operator is able to lift the load to its desired position
            by experiencing an effort that can always be controlled.

        abstract: We present preliminary results of a one degree of freedom (DOF)
            linear moving force augmenting device (FAD) with a force sensor for enhancing
            the lifting capabilities of a human user. We perform a stability test
            of the feedback loop formed by the device and a model of the human operator.
            It is shown that the operator lifts a small fraction of the total weight
            of the load. The proposed control scheme is illustrated using numerical
            simulations and an experiment.

        abstract: In a factory, final product needs to be thoroughly inspected before
            delivering to customer. This is achieved by factory floor tester. Factory
            floor tester is responsible for automation of testing final product's
            completeness, assembly exactness and correct functionality. The project
            deals with design of the factory floor tester. This includes the hardware
            design, software design, integration of software with fabricated hardware
            and testing the whole setup. Hardware design includes the design of electronic
            circuit and simulation. Software design is development of a GUI interface
            to the designed hardware. This includes the coding in embedded C, embedded
            C++ and Visual C++. The software code and other data is dumped in the
            fabricated unit's memory, the unit is allowed to interface with the PC
            for the GUI module to take control over it. The final phase is to test
            and debug the software to assure the proper integration between both software
            and hardware setup. The advancement of virtual instrument allows us to
            perform more complex testing operations. This project also deals with
            developing an test equipment which is responsible of testing complex functionalities
            like GSM communication (multi threading operations), handling multiple
            grounds effectively (implementing complex algorithms), connecting database
            and making database available for analysis (manipulating database over
            network). Identifying the System transfer function gives the detail information
            of the system. In this project we have attempted to automate the process
            of identifying the transfer function of an electrical system.
