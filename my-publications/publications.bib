A specific linear-integer structure of a generic mathematical model for Resilient Supply Chain Management System (RSCMS) makes it possible to reduce the originally given MCLP to two auxiliary optimization Knapsack-type problems. The equivalent transformation (separation) we propose provides a useful tool for an effective numerical treatment of the original MCLP and reduces the complexity of algorithms. The computational methodology we follow involves a specific Lagrange relaxation procedure. We give a rigorous formal analysis of the resulting algorithm and apply it to a practically oriented example of an optimal RSCMS design.",

	abstract = "This paper deals with the Maximal Covering Location Problem (MCLP) for Supply Chain optimization in the presence of incomplete information. A specific linear-integer structure of a generic mathematical model for Resilient Supply Chain Management System (RSCMS) makes it possible to reduce the originally given \{MCLP\} to two auxiliary optimization Knapsack-type problems. The equivalent transformation (separation) we propose provides a useful tool for an effective numerical treatment of the original \{MCLP\} and reduces the complexity of algorithms. The computational methodology we follow involves a specific Lagrange relaxation procedure. We give a rigorous formal analysis of the resulting algorithm and apply it to a practically oriented example of an optimal \{RSCMS\} design. "
