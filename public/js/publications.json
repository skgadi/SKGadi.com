A force sensor is attached to the load to capture the force applied by the human operator to the FAD. The control algorithm presented in this thesis allows the user to feel part of the load all the time, even at the rest position. A linear model for the HA is employed to study the stability of the FAD-HA interaction. As a depart from past works, this work presents a stability analysis considering time-delays in the human model. A key ingredient in the analysis is the use of the Rekasius substitution for replacing the time-delay terms. It is proved that the FAD-HA interaction is stable when the human model has no delays. When delays are considered in the human model, the analysis performed provides upper bounds for the time-delays below which a stable interaction is assured. Numerical simulations are presented, which allow assessing the FAD-HA interaction. Experimentation is performed with a laboratory prototype with which several human operators lift a load. It is observed that the FAD-HA interaction is stable and that the human operator is able to lift the load to its desired position by experiencing an effort that can always be controlled.","author":[{"first":"S.","last":"Gadi","middle":"K."}],"bibtex":"@thesis{Gadi2014a, type = {phdthesis}, gskthesislevel = \"PhD\", author = {S.

A force sensor is attached to the load to capture the force applied by the human operator to the FAD. The control algorithm presented in this thesis allows the user to feel part of the load all the time, even at the rest position. A linear model for the HA is employed to study the stability of the FAD-HA interaction. As a depart from past works, this work presents a stability analysis considering time-delays in the human model. A key ingredient in the analysis is the use of the Rekasius substitution for replacing the time-delay terms. It is proved that the FAD-HA interaction is stable when the human model has no delays. When delays are considered in the human model, the analysis performed provides upper bounds for the time-delays below which a stable interaction is assured. Numerical simulations are presented, which allow assessing the FAD-HA interaction. Experimentation is performed with a laboratory prototype with which several human operators lift a load. It is observed that the FAD-HA interaction is stable and that the human operator is able to lift the load to its desired position by experiencing an effort that can always be controlled.}, }","gskthesislevel":"PhD","gsktype":"pThesis","month":"May","pdf":"https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B6A_I6W9HjBDWTd0SVZETTZuaFU/view","school":"Centro de Investigación y de Estudios Avanzados del Instituto Politécnico Nacional (CINVESTAV-IPN)","title":"Modelado y Control de un Dispositivo de Aumento de Fuerza","type":"phdthesis","year":"2014"},"oliver2022":{"author":[{"first":"Edgar","last":"Garcia","middle":"Orlando Esparza"},{"first":"Oliver","last":"Galindo","middle":"Alejandro López"}],"bibtex":"@thesis{oliver2022, author = {Edgar Orlando Esparza Garcia and Oliver Alejandro López Galindo}, title = {Domótica utilizando WebThings y Raspberry Pi}, school = {Universidad de Colima}, year = {2022}, month = {2}, day = {15}, pdf = {https://drive.google.com/file/d/19uUKWxMZDQYbOn7wnYvG1yTR0IY8U4GZ/view}, }","day":"15","gsktype":"bTGuide","month":"2","pdf":"https://drive.google.com/file/d/19uUKWxMZDQYbOn7wnYvG1yTR0IY8U4GZ/view","school":"Universidad de Colima","title":"Domótica utilizando WebThings y Raspberry Pi","type":"thesis","year":"2022"},"s20061694":{"abstract":"This article presents a methodology to recycle and upgrade a 4-DOF educational robot manipulator with a gripper.
