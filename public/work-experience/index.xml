      <description>Accomplishments  Designed a factory floor tester (FFT) for an HVAC (heating, ventilation, and air conditioning) controller. The device under test (DUT) (i.e. HVAC controller) is placed inside an FFT. The FFT needs to verify all the specifications of the HVAC controller, like digital &amp;amp; analog inputs and outputs, Light emitting diodes (LED), resistance measurement etc. This is the final test done by the manufacturer before packing. Designed the software part of the FFT for a Remote monitoring unit (RMU) Tested many electronic devices for sending a feedback to the designing section and also performed tests to prepare the products to the standards of CE (Conformité Européenne) and FCC (Federal Communications Commission).</description>

Since SWT crew is responsible for bringing the oil to the surface for the first time, the safety of the personnel, the oil-well and the equipment is of very high priority. Xpert certification includes a training on the selection of equipment for a given SWT project.</description>
