      <description>Calculus to an engineer is wind to a sailboat In this post, I want to motivate engineering students to consider calculus as the most important mathematical tool. I will do this by explaining how essential it is for engineers with an analogy.

I would say the household tools such as the screwdrivers, wrenches, and pliers are comparable to the mathematical operations such as addition, multiplication, and division.</description>
