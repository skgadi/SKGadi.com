      <description>Calculus to an engineer is wind to a sailboat I want to motivate engineering students to consider calculus as the most important mathematical tool. I will do this by explaining how essential it is for engineers with an analogy.
An analogy Let us begin the analogy by comparing nuts and bolts with numbers, tools with mathematical operations.
I would say the household tools such as the screwdrivers, wrenches, and pliers are comparable to the mathematical operations such as addition, multiplication, and division.</description>

      <description>The control theory uses the following waveforms.
StepSquareRectangularSineTriangularSawtoothThere are several techniques to produce these inputs. This post presents an easy way of creating and testing them.
Note that the functions presented here are easy to implement but not always efficient.
Generalized step function $S_0(t)$A step wave has only two states and changes from one state to another at a single instance of time.</description>
