### Accomplishments
* Designed a factory floor tester (FFT) for an HVAC (heating, ventilation, and air conditioning) controller. The device under test (DUT) (i.e. HVAC controller) is placed inside an FFT. The FFT needs to verify all the specifications of the HVAC controller, like digital & analog inputs and outputs, Light emitting diodes (LED), resistance measurement etc. This is the final test done by the manufacturer before packing.
* Designed the software part of the FFT for a Remote monitoring unit (RMU)
* Tested many electronic devices for sending a feedback to the designing section and also performed tests to prepare the products to the standards of CE (Conformité Européenne) and FCC (Federal Communications Commission). These tests include testing the specifications, the temperature range, the humidity range, the mechanical shock range, the radiation immunity range etc.
