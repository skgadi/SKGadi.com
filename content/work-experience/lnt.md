### Accomplishments
* Construction of the 66 KV double circuit transmission lines at Bawana, Delhi
	* Supervised the complete site work and undertook the planning part of the site.
	* Responsible for generating reports to the higher management like job cost report (JCR) and material reconciliation report etc.
	* Handled the sub-contractor and client billing. Followed up client billing until the accountant receives the check from the client.
