## Venue
[Instituto Tecnol√≥gico Superior de Misantla](http://itsm.edu.mx/)

## Time
9AM to 7PM on 8th and 9th of June 2017

## Errata
The first paragraph in the page six of the document [Genetic Algorithm for Solving Simple Mathematical Equality Problem](https://arxiv.org/ftp/arxiv/papers/1308/1308.4675.pdf) by Denny Hermawanto reads:

*If random number R\[1\] is greater than <b>P\[1\]</b> and smaller than <b>P\[2\]</b> then select Chromosome\[2\] as a chromosome in the new population for next generation:*

which should be corrected as:

*If random number R\[1\] is greater than <b>C\[1\]</b> and smaller than <b>C\[2\]</b> then select Chromosome\[2\] as a chromosome in the new population for next generation:*
